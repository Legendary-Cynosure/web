    - `This is a duolingo clone that uses react, vite, and demonstrates my proficiency in javascript. It's designated project description is that it is essentially like duolingo in that it has a cute passive agressive mascot, satisfying button sounds, and a bright color scheme.

As the course psuedomaterial (that is material used as a proof of concept) are in fact, data structures and competitive programing methods, this also serves to demonstrate my competency in these things to the fair judges at the bay valley tech code academy as well.`
